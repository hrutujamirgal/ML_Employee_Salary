### Response:
1. **Visual Representation:** Providing a line graph for data trend analysis.
2. **Detailed Insights:** Enabling users to access detailed job title data by clicking on specific years.
3. **User Interaction:** Users can sort rows and toggle between ascending and descending order for enhanced usability.
4. **Insightful Visualization:** Provision for users to gain insights through graphical representations by selecting parameters.
5. **Exploratory Capability:** Facility for users to explore insights for other dataset columns.
